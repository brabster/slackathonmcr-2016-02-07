# slackathonmcr-2016-02-07

Runs as NodeJS AWS Lambda function that responds to a [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) such as `/httpping example.com` in your Slack channel with a colour-coded HTTP response code and the response headers:

For the Slack and AWS setup, see @pixelcodeuk's [writeup of creating a slash command with AWS Lambda and API Gateway] (https://medium.com/@pixelcodeuk/create-a-slack-slash-command-with-aws-lambda-83fb172f9a74#.86ezyic1i)
